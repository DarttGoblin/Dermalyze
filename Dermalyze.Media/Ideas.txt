Task: Incorporate metadata with image processing.
Uniqueness: Most models focus only on images, but incorporating metadata can provide additional context and improve performance.
Challenges: Ensuring the model doesnâ€™t overfit to metadata and generalizes well across diverse populations.

Idea: Detection of rare skin cancer.
Uniqueness: Rare skin cancers are understudied due to limited labeled data, but self-supervised learning can help overcome this.
Challenges: Designing an effective self-supervised task for skin images.
