Title: Automated Skin Cancer Detection Using Dermoscopic Images
Description:
	This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for automated skin 
	cancer detection using dermoscopic images. By utilizing large, publicly 
	available datasets like the ISIC Archive and HAM10000, the model will 
	classify skin lesions into categories such as melanoma, basal cell 
	carcinoma, and benign lesions. Advanced deep learning techniques, 
	including transfer learning, data augmentation, and ensemble learning, 
	will be employed to enhance accuracy and generalization. The final solution 
	will be integrated into a user-friendly web interface, allowing users 
	to upload images and receive diagnostic predictions. This tool aims to 
	support dermatologists in making faster and more accurate assessments, 
	particularly in resource-limited settings, ultimately contributing to 
	early detection and improved patient outcomes.
