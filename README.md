Title: Automated Skin Cancer Detection Using Dermoscopic Images. ðŸ”¬<br><br>
Description:<br>
Dermalyze is an intelligent, deep learning-based system designed to assist in the early detection of skin cancer through image analysis. By combining a convolutional neural network with patient metadataâ€”including age, sex, and lesion localizationâ€”Dermalyze performs multi-class classification of skin lesions into categories such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and actinic keratoses.
Users can upload a dermoscopic image via a web interface, enter relevant patient details, and receive a real-time prediction along with confidence scores. The backend model is built using TensorFlow and served through a Flask API, while the frontend offers a clean, user-friendly interface. Dermalyze aims to support dermatologists and general practitioners by improving diagnostic accuracy, especially in resource-limited or remote settings.
